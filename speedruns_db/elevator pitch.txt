pitch: Speedruns DB

purpose: catalog of games, their top 50 speedruns, runners, and routes


rough draft:

I love to speedrun games; but more particularly, I enjoy learning the routes and 
the glitches that make them possible. I want to design a site where
the fastest times for my favorite games can be cataloged, along with
the tricks and explanations of the science behind them.


Feedback:
- Add the words "wicked cool" somewhere in there
- Suggested reword to be "...along with the tricks complete 
with the explanations behind how they work
- First sentence is great
- Vote for keep as is
