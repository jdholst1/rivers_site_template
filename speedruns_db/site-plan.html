Follow the instructions on the activity in iLearn then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

      <h3>Welcome to Speedruns DB!</h3>
      <p>
        This site is dedicated to keeping track of speedruns for select N64 games.
        This includes not only listing the top runs for each game, but also outlining the routes and giving
        explanations for the glitches and tricks that make these runs possible.
      </p>

      </ul>
      <h3>Tricks and Glitches</h3>
      <p>
        The routes for these runs are built on the foundation of the tricks and glitches that make them possible.
        Glitches allow us to skip cutscenes, travel faster, and skip in-game barriers that take time and patience
        that we don't have. As you may already know, some of these are more game-breaking than others, the furthest
        extent being ACE (or arbitrary code execution). How else could we condense the time it takes to beat a game
        that normally takes several hours down to less than ten minutes?

      </ul>
      <h3>Categories</h3>
      <p>
        One of the wonders of speedrunning is the variety of categories that rise up over the years. Just about Any
        game has the basics of any% and 100% runs, but some games have caught too much interest to limit it to only
        these. Some categories arise in response to game-breaking glitches. These categories usually are made solely
        to exclude use of the glitch; one very well-known example of this is no-SRM(stale-reference manipulation) in
        OoT, since SRM trivializes most aspects of the game.
      </p>
      <h3>Routing</h3>
      <p>
        Designing routes isn't too different from planning a trip in real life. True, you may not plan a vacation with
        the sole intent to get everywhere in record time, but you still have choices available that you can map out.
        Routing can be as simple as playing through the game and finding out through experience what route is fastest.
        Other times, it takes careful evaluation of what abilities we have and what requirements we need to fulfill to
        complete a valid run.
