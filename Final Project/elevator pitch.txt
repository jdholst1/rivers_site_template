pitch: speedruns DB

purpose: catalog of games, their top 50 speedruns, runners, and routes

I love to speedrun games; but more particularly, I enjoy learning the routes and 
the glitches that make them possible. I want to design a site where
the fastest times for my favorite games can be cataloged, along with
the tricks and explanations of the science behind them.
